Your opponent is a brat. 

Whenever they are materially disadvantaged, they ask to switch sides. 

Good luck!

## Caviats
- You cannot create a material disadvantage, while putting the opponent in check. This is because the sides would switch, and the bot can immediately capture your King
- It would be impossible to win against a bot trained on this mode. Thus, to keep things fun, we use a regular chess bot, and occasionally make it *blunder*
